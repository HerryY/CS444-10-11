\section{}
\subsection{What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}
 I believe the main point of this assignment is to understand how the SLOB first-fit alogorithm works and implement the best-fit allocation algorithm.  Also it does not say it in the assignment but also get the concurrency four assignment working as well.  
\subsection{How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.}

\subsection{How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.}
We implemented some sys calls that returned the amount of memory used and the amount of free memory. We used this to calculate the percentage of fragmentation.
\subsection{What did you learn?}
We learned how to implement the best-fit memory allocation algorithm and Linux system calls.
